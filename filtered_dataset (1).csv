Case2,Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386,"The general principles governing the exercise of the discretion to award indemnity costs after rejection by an unsuccessful party of a so called Calderbank letter were set out in the judgment of the Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386. In summary those principles are: 1. Mere refusal of a ""Calderbank offer"" does not itself warrant an order for indemnity costs. In this connection it may be noted that Jessup J in Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 42 said that (at [6]): if the rejection of such an offer is to ground a claim for indemnity costs, it must be by reason of some circumstance other than that the offer happened to comply with the Calderbank principle. 2. To obtain an order for indemnity costs the offeror must show that the refusal to accept it was unreasonable. 3. The reasonableness of the conduct of the offeree is to be viewed in the light of the circumstances that existed when the offer was rejected.",cited
Case5,Dr Martens Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 602,"The preceding general principles inform the exercise of the discretion. That discretion is not to be fettered by transformation of approaches and practices developed through the cases into quasi statutory rules. In John S Hayes &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 201 , Hill J said (at 203): care must be taken not to circumscribe the discretion by reference to closed categories. It is not a necessary condition of the power to award costs that a collateral purpose be shown. The categories warranting the exercise of the discretion are not closed ...

Case9,Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46,"recent decision of the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 clarifies this issue. Gleeson CJ and Crennan J (at [19]), after referring to various cases dealing with the grant of interlocutory injunctions in cases of defamation, formulated the general principles governing the grant of such relief in the following terms: ""in all applications for an interlocutory injunction, a court will ask whether the plaintiff has shown that there is a serious question to be tried as to the plaintiff's entitlement to relief, has shown that the plaintiff is likely to suffer injury for which damages will not be an adequate remedy, and has shown that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction.""",applied
Case14,George v Cluning (1979) 53 ALJR 767 (note),"Strictly speaking, a cheque, even a bank cheque, is not a form of legal tender. Subject to some particular contractual or statutory provision, the only forms of legal tender remain Australian notes or, subject to the limits specified, Australian coins see s 36 of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 and s 16 of the Currency Act 1965 respectively. However, in general trade and commerce, as Mason J observed in George v Cluning (1979) 53 ALJR 767 (note) by reference to Canadian authority, a payment by cheque can amount to sufficient payment if not objected to on that account. In this case there was no objection made by the Deputy Commissioner on account of Ganter's endeavouring to settle its indebtedness by the tendering of a cheque only, as I have noted a signification that it was accepted subject to a condition that the cheque would be paid on presentation",followed
Case15,Australian Mid-Eastern Club Limited v Yassim (1989) 1 ACSR 399,"None of this is to suggest that the Deputy Commissioner was under any obligation to accept the proffered cheque. When the history of Ganter's endeavours to pay the debt after the filing of the winding up application is recalled and that the company was, by operation of s 459C(2)(a) the Corporations Act 2001 presumed to be insolvent the Deputy Commissioner would have been entitled not to accept the cheque.

As French J pointed out in ACCC v Real Estate Institute (WA) [1999] FCA 1387 ; (1999) 95 FCR 114 at 131, the question whether there is a sufficient nexus between the orders sought and the contraventions alleged involves an evaluative judgment by the Court which will depend heavily upon the circumstances of the particular case.",cited

Nothing in Gye v McIntyre [1991] HCA 60 ; (1991) 171 CLR 609 , in my opinion, provides any succour whatsoever to the notion that s 86 imposes affirmative duties.

I said the following (at [6]): In my opinion, this is an appropriate case for the award of indemnity costs. Mr Rana made allegations about payment for the tickets and what occurred at the Convention Centre which were critical to his case and he must have known were untrue. Those allegations should not have been made. He claimed that he had suffered loss and damage of $1 million but he proved no loss or damage. He altered a document, namely, a receipt, so that his case would appear stronger. These circumstances alone justify an award of indemnity costs. A further and probably independent reason for awarding indemnity costs is that he refused an offer of $400 in relation to a claim which I dismissed. In all the circumstances, it is appropriate to order that costs be paid on an indemnity basis.",referred to

He observed that, by providing that trial by a justice alone was the usual mode of trial then available in the High Court, unless that Court ordered otherwise, the relevant legislation had settled on a general policy for such a mode of trial. Fullagar J observed that one could hardly expect much guidance from decided cases in considering whether a case warranted departure from that usual mode of trial.",discussed

He submits that a right to seek particulars is no answer and, in any event, the Commission has apparently provided such particulars as it can provide. He submits that if that is not the case, the Commission should provide such available particulars and, if there are none, the offending paragraphs and then the entire pleading should be struck out.

Accepting that the Commission cannot identify all of the members of the group and that the pleading alleges directions by unidentified members, the Commission relies upon Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission [1995] 3 All ER 918.

Case2846,Re Coleman [1888] 39 Ch D 443,"The Master of the Rolls in Re Nelson distinguished the case of Re Coleman [1888] 39 Ch D 443 which was relied upon by the appellants. In Re Coleman the trustees had power to apply the income of a trust fund for the benefit of a class or any one of them to the exclusion of the others. One of the beneficiaries assigned his share and claimed unsuccessfully that an appropriate portion, one quarter of the income, should be paid to his assignee. Swinfen Eady MR said of that case (at 921): 'The answer to that was that he did not take an equal fourth or any other share and the trustees could have applied the whole of the income to the other members of that class. That is quite a different case from the present case, where all the members of the class have assigned their shares to the mortgagees.'",cited

Case2854,Craig v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1945] HCA 1 ; (1945) 70 CLR 441,ASIC submitted that a contingent interest in property equates to a proprietary interest. It cited Craig v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1945] HCA 1 ; (1945) 70 CLR 441. That case concerned the application of s 8(4) of the Estate Duty Assessment Act 1914 (Cth). The Act levied estate duty on the value of the estate of deceased persons. Included in the property brought into the estate for the purposes of the assessment of estate duty was property 'comprised in a settlement made by the deceased person under which he had any interest of any kind for his life...'.,cited
Case2857,Ascot Investments Pty Ltd v Harper [1981] HCA 1 ; (1981) 148 CLR 337,"As discussed earlier, the beneficiary who effectively controls the trustee's power of selection because he is the trustee or one of them and/or has the power to appoint a new trustee has something approaching a general power and the ownership of the trust property. There are cases in the Family Law jurisdiction which have dealt with like circumstance. In Ascot Investments Pty Ltd v Harper [1981] HCA 1 ; (1981) 148 CLR 337, Gibbs J said (at 354-355): '... if a company is completely controlled by one party to a marriage, so that in reality an order against the company is an order against the party, the fact that in form the order appears to affect the rights of the company may not necessarily invalidate it.'

Case2858,In the Marriage of Ashton (1986) 11 Fam LR 457,"The Full Court of the Family Court of Australia in In the Marriage of Ashton (1986) 11 Fam LR 457 considered a case in which the husband was appointor of a family trust. He had the power to remove and appoint the trustee and could appoint himself. The trustee had the power to alter the terms of the trust at will. He was not a beneficiary of the trust but had received income from it. He was found to be 'in full control of the assets of the trust'. There were 'good grounds for saying the trust is no more than the husband's alter ego'. Strauss J said (at [14]): 'In the result, having regard to the powers and discretions which the husband has, and having regard to what had in fact taken place, for the purposes of s 79 [of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth)] , the husband's power of appointment, and all the attributes it carries with it, amounts to de facto ownership of the property of the trust.'",cited
Case2859,In the Marriage of Goodwin (1990) 101 FLR 386,"A similar trust arrangement existed in In the Marriage of Goodwin (1990) 101 FLR 386. The trial judge had found that the reality in that case was that no person other than the husband had any real interest in the property or income of the trust except at the will of the husband. In upholding the trial judge, the Full Court said (at 392): '... we have no doubt that his Honour was entitled to find that the trust property was in reality the property of the husband in the present case. The husband had the sole power of appointment of the trustee which was a creature under his control and he was a beneficiary to whom the trustee could make payments exclusive of other beneficiaries as the husband saw fit.' In the case of In Marriage of Davidson (No 2) (1990) 101 FLR 373 the Full Court observed (at 382): 'Whatever may have been the position 100 years ago Australian courts today have to look at the reality of the situation and the purpose which family trusts serve today.'",cited

It is said that they are distinguishable. In my view the appellant mistakes the use the Magistrate was making of these cases. She accepted that they were distinguishable. She was deprecating precipitate action on the part of the appellant, as were the judges in the two cases relied on. The Magistrate did not commit an appealable error by relying on what was said in those cases about precipitate action, as a relevant consideration, simply because the cases are distinguishable on their facts.",cited
